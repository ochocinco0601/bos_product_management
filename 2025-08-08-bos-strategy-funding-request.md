## Business Observability: Strategic Plan and Funding Request

### Purpose and Problem Statement

This document outlines the Business Observability capability - its purpose, required executive commitments, and the actions needed to make it operational and sustained.

### Executive Summary (for decision)

Our current approach to monitoring incorrectly assumes technical health equals business health. We have seen the direct impact of this assumption during recent loan funding incidents, where technical systems reported "green" status while critical, time-sensitive closing deadlines were at risk.

This gap hides real business impact - missed customer commitments and revenue loss - and prevents us from knowing if we are solving the business problem.

The Business Observability System (BOS) fixes this. It moves us from measuring technical uptime to validating business outcomes through a shared delivery contract where Product, Development, and Platform SRE are jointly accountable.

**Contrast:** Old: Dashboards show “green” while business functions fail silently. New: BOS shows whether the loan-funding service met its daily target by 8 AM - and flags when it did not - preventing missed closings and compliance exposure.

We support 387 applications but lack a consistent way to identify which services matter most to customers or whether they meet expectations. Observability is fragmented. Incident response often starts without business context. Result: critical failures can sit behind technical green status, delaying customer recovery and misprioritizing fixes.

### Executive Decision Request

We need joint approval on the following to proceed without delay:

* **Approve** BOS as the standard for defining business outcomes and Service Level Objectives (SLOs).  
* **Fund and launch** the Phase 1 pilot for 37 high-impact applications at **$59,850**. See **Analysis: Prioritization and Funding Model** for allocation breakdown.  
* **Nominate** Product Owners/SMEs for each pilot application to complete BOS outcome definitions and SLO templates. Each executive will nominate for their respective team:  
  * **Product Executive** - Product Owners and Business SMEs to define business outcomes, impact thresholds, and SLOs.  
  * **Development Executive** - Lead Developers/Architects to translate SLOs into measurable Service Level Indicators (SLIs).  
  * **Platform SRE Executive** - Platform SRE leads to implement SLIs in monitoring tools and operational dashboards.  
* **Approve** the BOS Operating Model (governance cadence, KPIs, audit loop) so delivery contracts remain enforceable over time.

## What We Need

### A Single Source of Truth for Business Services

To connect technical performance to business outcomes, BOS requires a foundational system of record. This authoritative registry will serve as the single source of truth for all business-critical services.

For each service (e.g., "Loan Funding Service"), the registry will define its owner, dependencies, and business context, including the specific SLOs and impact metrics. This registry is the backbone of the BOS framework; its data feeds our dashboards, enriches incident alerts, and enables automated reporting.

### Outcome Definition Pattern

Each business-critical service will have its outcome defined in a standard template using a clear, measurable Service Level Objective (SLO). This makes abstract business goals explicit. For example:

**“Loan funding service - 100% of scheduled closings funded by 8:00 AM CT; alert at 7:30 AM if projected shortfall \> 5%.”**

The nominated cross-functional teams will be responsible for defining these outcomes and implementing the underlying technical measurements (SLIs).

A **repeatable, scalable framework** for end-to-end business observability across all services, integrated into existing delivery processes (e.g., SAFe PI planning and Scrum Agile Release Trains) and compatible with current monitoring platforms. BOS’s structured data model enables automation of dashboard and alert creation, translating defined business context directly into production monitoring configurations.

### Integration Touchpoints

BOS data and IDs will integrate with:

* **Service Registry / CMDB:** BOS service IDs link to authoritative service records.  
* **Incident Management (ServiceNow):** BOS metadata (service, business step, SLO, impact) enriches incidents.  
* **Alert Pipeline (e.g., BigPanda):** BOS tags enable precise owner routing.  
* **Monitoring Platforms (Splunk, AppDynamics, etc.):** SLI queries built from BOS IDs.  
* **Reporting / Analytics:** BOS outcomes drive executive dashboards and PI planning metrics.

## Executive Commitment Required

### The Problem

The current "Start of Day" process creates false confidence. It relies on manual checks that do not show true business impact. This reflects a systemic **Organizational Accountability Challenge**: technical teams are held responsible for business outcomes they cannot define or measure. This gap prevents answering critical questions like: *What business impact is this causing?* and *Which business process is affected?*

### Commitment Required

The BOS framework requires an explicit **Delivery Contract** grounded in BOS’s shared responsibility governance model - across product, development, and platform SRE personas. This model prevents impossible accountability scenarios, enforces role boundaries, and eliminates unsustainable reliance on tribal knowledge.

* **Business/Product:** Provide flow definitions, business success criteria, and impact thresholds as **explicit requirements** (not assumptions). Use BOS templates to capture the validation logic - including business context, stakeholder impacts, and indicators for business, process, and system signals - so what to monitor and why is unambiguous.  
* **Development:** Instrument applications to emit the business-critical telemetry specified by Product. Translate abstract SLOs into concrete, measurable SLIs and ensure that logs, traces, and metrics are implemented to make the entire business process observable.  
* **Platform SRE:** Deliver dashboards, alerts, and instrumentation built from these business **specifications**.

This delivery contract requires a dedicated time commitment: key members from Product, Development, and Platform SRE must be available for weekly working sessions to define, instrument, and monitor business outcomes.

## Operating Model & Governance

* **Owner:** Central SRE maintains the BOS delivery contract framework and enforces governance across product, development, and platform SRE teams.  
* **Cadence:** Monthly governance review with a quarterly executive summary.  
* **KPIs:**  
  * **Nomination Fulfillment:** % of executive-nominated roles (Product Owners/SMEs, Development leads, Platform SRE leads) that have completed BOS outcome definitions and SLO templates for their assigned pilot services.  
  * **Outcome Definition Coverage:** % of business-critical pilot services with approved BOS templates containing outcomes, SLOs, and SLIs.  
  * **SLO Performance:** % of services consistently meeting their defined SLOs over the past quarter.  
  * **Time-to-Impact Identification:** Median time from incident start to confirmed business impact visibility.  
  * **Contract Freshness:** % of BOS delivery contracts reviewed and validated within the last quarter.  
* **Audit Loop:** Quarterly review of delivery contracts. Gaps trigger remediation plans with follow-up in the next governance cycle.

### Adoption & Enablement Plan

* **BOS Onboarding:** 90-minute orientation for Product Owners, Development leads, and Platform SRE leads on BOS templates, SLO/SLI definition, and tooling integration.  
* **Reference Materials:** One-page BOS authoring guide and outcome definition examples stored in the BOS System of Record.  
* **Ongoing Support:** Weekly office hours during the pilot to assist teams with BOS template completion and signal implementation.

## Use Case: Real-Time Customer Impact Detection

* **Current State:** Telemetry is fragmented. Registration is manual. Standards are inconsistent.  
* **Future State:** Flow registration is automated from code. Telemetry standards are enforced through Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs). Customer journeys are monitored in real time on demand. A unified platform provides clear business impact visibility.

## Our Structured Engagement Process

To ensure a consistent and scalable rollout, we follow a structured, six-step process for each business service in the pilot. This factory model translates business knowledge into fully observable systems with clear, traceable ownership.

1. **Define Business Flow Structure:** We begin by working with Product Owners to map the high-level business process into its distinct stages and steps.  
2. **Populate Observability Templates:** For each step, we use a standardized template to capture the specific business context, success criteria, and potential failure impacts. This is a collaborative effort between Product, Development, and SRE leads.  
3. **Build Signal Matrix:** The information from the completed template is then translated into a "Signal Matrix," which categorizes every signal (Business, Process, or System) and assigns ownership.  
4. **Create Business Service Playbook:** We generate a concise playbook for each business function. This playbook summarizes the key signals, explains *why they matter* to the business, and maps alerts to specific team actions.  
5. **Generate Dashboard Mockups:** The Signal Matrix and Playbook are used to generate dashboard mockups that visually represent the business flow, its health, and clear ownership.  
6. **Ensure Complete Traceability:** In the final step, we link every dashboard metric back to its source template and owner, creating an auditable, end-to-end record of accountability.

## Stakeholder Requirements Framework

To ensure consistency, stakeholder input is captured through a structured, repeatable process. Product Owners use this guided framework to translate their deep business expertise into the specific, measurable requirements needed for business observability. This structured process involves defining:

* **The Service's Business Purpose:** What the service must accomplish to be successful.  
* **The Success Baseline:** The specific metric (e.g., volume, value, or success rate) that defines a successful outcome.  
* **The Impact of Failure:** The specific customer, financial, or operational consequences of an outage.  
* **The Business Metric (SLI):** The real-time metric that directly quantifies that business impact.

This structured approach empowers our Product Owners to create precise, measurable business requirements for every service in the pilot.

## Timeline and Scale-Up Plan

### Phase 1: Pilot Execution (Current)

* **Goal**: Validate the BOS methodology by processing 37 high-impact, business-critical applications (10% of portfolio) through the BOS Factory workflow.  
* **Workflow**: The factory model includes: Outline (bare-bones process flow), Enrich (add signals and ownership), Validate (RACI/stakeholder review), and Visualize (dashboards and reference cards).  
* **Decision Gate**: A "Go/No-Go" decision will determine if we proceed to Phase 2\. Executive leadership will review the pilot outcomes against the following criteria:

| Status | Criteria | Executive Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Go** 🟢 | Customer impact is quantifiable within minutes for **all 37** scoped applications. The process is systematic and repeatable with minimal manual effort. | Proceed to Phase 2\. |
| **Needs Correction** 🟡 | Customer impact is quantifiable within minutes for **≥70%** of applications, but significant manual intervention or tribal knowledge persists. | **Re-evaluate and Rescope:** Adjust the BOS Factory workflow for the remaining pilot applications or extend Phase 1 with revised funding. |
| **No-Go** 🔴 | Customer impact is quantifiable within minutes for **\<50%** of applications, or the process remains fundamentally manual or tribal. | **Pause and Re-evaluate:** Pause this framework for root cause analysis. Reassess assumptions, re-scope, or explore alternatives. |

### Phase 2: Scale-Up and Integration

* **Goal**: Scale the BOS methodology across the remaining 350+ applications.  
* **Approach**: Implement a repeatable, pattern-based adoption model, prioritizing new applications using a complexity-based sizing model.  
* **Onboarding Strategy for Legacy/Complex Services**:  
  * **Tier 1 – New/Greenfield**: Apply full BOS onboarding immediately.  
  * **Tier 2 – Existing Moderate Complexity**: Use BOS templates with partial automation; integrate during planned release cycles.  
  * **Tier 3 – Legacy/High-Risk**: Apply a phased BOS onboarding focused on the highest-value flows first, with manual telemetry mapping until refactoring is feasible.  
* **Resourcing**: Secure funding and dedicated resources based on pilot success and a refined effort model.

## Implementation Risks

* **Status Quo Costs:** Unable to confirm if systems solve business problems. Leads to delayed incident response, misprioritized fixes, and underreported customer harm.  
* **Execution Risks:** The primary execution risks are a lack of business context from unavailable domain expertise and project delays caused by insufficient stakeholder participation. The BOS framework is designed to directly mitigate these risks through its structured 'Engagement Strategy' and the shared accountability defined in the 'Delivery Contract'.

---

## Risk & Compliance in BOS

Risk and compliance requirements are built into BOS from the start - not added later.

* Product Owners use BOS guiding questions to flag legal, regulatory, and compliance obligations for each service.  
* Development builds telemetry to measure those obligations.  
* Platform SRE monitors and reports them alongside all other BOS outcomes.

This ensures compliance-sensitive flows are defined, instrumented, and visible in operational dashboards from day one.

---

## Progress Snapshot

* **Completed:** Stakeholder identification and pilot application selection.  
* **In Progress:** Discovery workshops and flow documentation.  
* **Next:** Instrumentation, dashboard buildout, and feedback loop creation.

---

## Urgency Reinforcement

The existing gap between our technical monitoring and business reality represents a significant and ongoing operational risk. Every future incident will continue to result in delayed impact analysis and misprioritized fixes. The only way to mitigate this risk is to systematically close the gap through continued investment in the BOS framework.

## Metadata Enrichment Framework

### 1\. Business Context Tagging

* **What to Tag:** Business flows, customer segments, service tiers, upstream and downstream dependencies.  
* **Why:** Links telemetry to customer-facing functionality for meaningful impact assessment.  
* **How:** Use a standardized BOS data model with namespaces, versioning, and naming conventions integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

### 2\. Customer Impact Metrics

To provide immediate context during an incident, telemetry will be enriched with metrics that describe the specific business impact. These metrics are categorized by the type of failure and the baseline for success:

* **Impact Categories:** All business impacts are classified into one of four standard categories: **Customer Experience**, **Financial**, **Legal/Risk**, or **Operational**.  
* **Success Baselines:** For each service, success is measured against a clear business-value baseline, such as the **volume** of transactions (e.g., number of loans funded), the **value** of transactions (e.g., dollar amount disbursed), or the **success rate** of operations (e.g., percentage of successful payments).

This structured approach ensures that when a failure occurs, we can instantly and precisely communicate its business consequence.

### 3\. Telemetry Enrichment & Correlation

* **Function:** Normalize and correlate MELTS - Metrics, Events, Logs, Traces, Synthetics - with ITIL incident data using shared keys (e.g., time, transaction ID, service name).  
* **Outcome:** Enables fast, accurate root cause analysis and real-time business impact visibility.  
* **Governance Link:** Ensures all enriched telemetry is trusted, traceable, and maintained under BOS governance - forming the data foundation for BOS dashboards, executive reporting, and KPI tracking.
