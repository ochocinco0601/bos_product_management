# Business Flow Monitoring â€“ Role-Based Communication

## ðŸŽ¯ Track 1: Executive + Director Communication

**Purpose:** Strategic alignment, funding, prioritization, stakeholder engagement, and outcome framing.

### SLO Partnership Framework for Home Lending Technology

#### Purpose & Problem Statement

â€¢ We support 387 applications but lack visibility regarding which services are most critical to our customers.
â€¢ Our observability tools are mature, but we need **business context** to know what to monitor and measure.
â€¢ We treat issues as tech problems, but there are many **business flow gaps**.

#### What We Need

â€¢ A shared understanding of critical flows.
â€¢ A shared understanding of customer-facing services.
â€¢ Defined business processes and user journeys.
â€¢ A system of record to map and track these flows.
â€¢ Defined measurable service expectations.

#### What Success Looks Like

â€¢ Business impact is identified quickly during incidents.
â€¢ Ownership is clearly defined for all business-critical signals.
â€¢ Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) is reduced for customer-impacting issues.
â€¢ Dashboards and alerts reflect business priorities and are actively used during incident response.

#### What's In It for You

â€¢ Immediate clarity on how incidents affect customer and business outcomes.
â€¢ Ability to make informed decisions during incidents using business-aligned dashboards and alerts.
â€¢ Clear ownership of business-critical signals and accountability for service performance.

### Use Case: Real-Time Customer Impact Detection

**Today:** Partial telemetry, manual flow registration, inconsistent standards.
**Future State:**

â€¢ Automatically register flows from code repositories.
â€¢ Enforce telemetry standards via NFRs.
â€¢ Enable real-time and on-demand monitoring of customer journeys.
â€¢ Provide single-platform visibility into service status and functionality.

### Engagement Strategy with Product & Business Owners

| Step | Action | Outcome |
|------|--------|---------|
| A. Identify Key Stakeholders | List product owners and business leads for each major service area. | Clear ownership and accountability. |
| B. Conduct Discovery Workshops | Host sessions to walk through customer journeys and business processes. Use real scenarios (e.g., applying for a mortgage, uploading documents). | Capture business-critical flows and pain points. |
| C. Define Business-Critical Services | Ask: "What services, if disrupted, would directly impact customers?" | Prioritized list of services to monitor. |
| D. Map Internal to External Services | Create visual maps showing how internal systems support customer-facing flows. | Transparency into dependencies and impact. |
| E. Quantify Customer Impact | Collaborate to define metrics: # of customers affected, duration of impact, business value lost. | Business-aligned SLO targets. |

## System of Record Design

**Goal:** Centralized repository capturing flows, ownership, linked services, SLOs, and impact metrics.
**Suggested Format:** Confluence, SharePoint, or custom portal with visual maps and editable access.

## Stakeholder Interview Guide

â€¢ "What are the top 3 things your customers rely on daily?"
â€¢ "If this service went down, how would it affect your customers?"
â€¢ "How do you know when a customer is having a bad experience?"
â€¢ "Who owns the business process behind this service?"
â€¢ "We're not asking for technical detailsâ€”we're asking for your expertise in how customers interact with your product."

## Analysis: Prioritization and Funding Model

| Activity | Estimated Hours |
|----------|-----------------|
| Identify critical flows | 76 |
| Engage with product/business owners | 114 |
| Document business flows | 76 |
| Implement tracing and instrumentation | 152 |
| Build dashboards | 114 |
| **Total** | **532** |

**FTE-months:** 3.33
**Estimated Funding:** $59,850 (based on $18,000/month per FTE)

## Summary Recommendations Table

| Capability | Purpose | Implementation |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Business Flow Tagging | Link telemetry to customer journeys | Use service registry and CI/CD tagging |
| Impact Quantification | Show how many users were affected | Correlate logs with session/user IDs |
| Regulatory Flags | Identify compliance-sensitive flows | Tag flows and alerts with regulatory metadata |
| Enrichment Layer | Normalize and correlate MELTS + ITIL | Build shared schema and enrichment services |
| Dashboards | Visualize business vs. tech impact | Use Tableau or Power BI with enriched data |

## Authoritative Business Service Registry

â€¢ Source-of-truth for critical services and dependencies.
â€¢ Version-controlled and CI/CD integrated.

## Regulatory Relevance

â€¢ Flag flows tied to compliance (e.g., disclosures, payments).
â€¢ Trace SLA breaches and regulatory thresholds.

## Key Metadata Elements to Capture

â€¢ Business Context Tags
â€¢ Customer Impact Metrics
â€¢ Regulatory Relevance
â€¢ Telemetry Enrichment Layer

## âœ… Progress Snapshot

â€¢ âœ… **Completed:**
  â—‹ Stakeholder identification

## ðŸš¨ Urgency Reinforcement

Early findings confirm that many incidents lack business impact correlation. Without enriched telemetry and flow mapping, we risk misprioritizing fixes and underreporting customer harm. This reinforces the need for continued prioritization and investment in business flow observability.

## Metadata Enrichment Framework

### 1. Business Context Tagging

â€¢ **What to tag:** Business flows, customer segments, service tiers, upstream/downstream dependencies.
â€¢ **Why:** Enables correlation between telemetry and customer-facing functionality.
â€¢ **How:** Use a standardized data model with namespaces, versioning, and naming conventions integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

### 2. Customer Impact Metrics

â€¢ **Key fields:**
  â—‹ Number of affected users (via session IDs, transaction logs).
  â—‹ Type of impact: degraded experience, failed transaction, delayed response.
  â—‹ Severity: financial loss, data inconsistency, regulatory breach.
â€¢ **Telemetry correlation:** Use MELTS (Metrics, Events, Logs, Traces, Synthetics) to trace impact across layers.

### 3. Regulatory Relevance

â€¢ Flag flows tied to compliance (e.g., disclosures, payments, fraud detection).
â€¢ Trace SLAs and thresholds to determine if regulatory obligations were breached.
â€¢ **Use case:** Automatically detect and report regulatory-impacting incidents using enriched telemetry.

### 4. Authoritative Business Service Registry

â€¢ **Purpose:** Maintain a source-of-truth for critical services and their business flows.
â€¢ **Features:**
  â—‹ ADS (Authoritative Data Source) and SoR (System of Record).
  â—‹ Lists critical business services and dependencies.
  â—‹ Tags external customer workflows and defines SLIs/SLOs.

### 5. Telemetry Enrichment Layer

â€¢ **Function:** Normalize and correlate MELTS with ITIL data using shared keys (e.g., time, transaction ID, service name).
â€¢ **Outcome:** Enables fast, accurate root cause analysis and customer impact assessment.
