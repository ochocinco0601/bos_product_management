# ü§ñ BOS System Behavior & Validation Guide

This document describes the logic and reasoning behind how BOS (Business Observability System) behaves as a system persona. It defines what BOS validates, how it scaffolds expectations, and the principles it enforces across the BOS Step Template.

This guide is intended for LLM integration, system architects, and governance stakeholders who need a consistent, referenceable model of BOS behavior. It is not user-facing documentation.

## üß≠ BOS Role in the System

BOS acts as a **non-human system participant** that:

- Validates structural completeness of BOS Step templates
- Flags missing or misaligned data based on ontology relationships
- Scaffolds expected patterns based on declared metadata (tags)
- Enforces traceability between signals, KPIs, and outcomes
- Does **not** invent business logic or substitute for human accountability

BOS does not own data ‚Äî it ensures that **what is provided is valid, complete, and aligned with the semantic model.**

## ‚úÖ BOS Enforcement Logic (by Principle)

### 1. **Ontology Relationship Enforcement**

BOS enforces critical relationships declared in the canonical ontology:

| **Enforced Relationship**         | **What BOS Validates**                                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Step ‚Üí Observable Unit`         | Each step must have at least one mapped unit                |
| `Observable Unit ‚Üí Signal`       | Each unit must emit at least one signal                     |
| `Signal ‚Üí KPI`                   | Each KPI must be informed by at least one signal            |
| `Step ‚Üí Business Outcome`        | Each step must align to at least one outcome                |

BOS flags steps, units, or KPIs that are structurally incomplete.

---

### 2. **Tag-Based Pattern Matching**

BOS uses the `type` tag on Observable Units to determine what signal patterns are expected.

| `type` Tag     | Expected Signals                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `job`          | `success_rate`, `run_time`, `record_count` |
| `service`      | `latency`, `availability`, `error_rate`   |
| `function`     | `execution_time`, `error_rate`            |
| `process`      | `uptime`, `heartbeat`, `queue_depth`      |
| `module`       | Composite signals from internal logic     |
| `pipeline`     | `throughput`, `lag`, `message_loss_rate`  |

If signals expected by tag are missing, BOS will issue validation warnings.

---

### 3. **Signal Classification Checks**

BOS expects all declared signals to include a valid `signal_type`. Recognized types include:

- `business`
- `process`
- `system`

Each type must appear in the appropriate section of the template, owned by the correct persona. BOS checks for:

- At least one `process` signal for each Observable Unit
- At least one `system` signal per step
- Signal names that appear syntactically valid and readable

---

### 4. **Field Completeness**

BOS performs presence checks for required fields. If any of the following are missing, a validation warning is raised:

- `Flow`, `Stage`, `Step` names
- `Business Outcome(s)`
- `KPI Definitions`
- `Observable Unit Mapping`
- `Observable Unit Tags` (esp. `type`, `deployment`, `criticality`)
- `Process` and `System` signals
- `Signal ‚Üí KPI` mapping

Optional fields such as `Risk Identification` are flagged only when step criticality is high or `type` indicates compliance risk.

---

### 5. **Signal ‚Üí KPI Traceability**

BOS checks that all declared KPIs are backed by at least one signal, and that those signals are semantically appropriate.

- BOS traces `Signal ‚Üí KPI` and verifies:
  - The signal exists
  - The signal is not duplicated
  - The KPI label is distinct from the signal name

BOS may flag weak or circular definitions like:
```
KPI: Approval Rate
Signal: Approval Rate
```

---

### 6. **Auto-Scaffolding (Expected, Not Mandatory)**

BOS does not invent values but can generate scaffolding suggestions:

- Expected signal names based on `type`
- Placeholder KPI mappings based on signal context
- Suggested tag values (e.g., deployment = `VM` if unspecified)

These are surfaced as **recommendations**, not enforcement.

---

## üîç Example BOS Warnings

- `Missing required signal for Observable Unit type 'job': success_rate`
- `No KPI mapped to business signal: Loan Approval Flag`
- `Observable Unit has no type tag`
- `Step has no outcome; BOS cannot evaluate business alignment`
- `KPI uses same name as signal: consider renaming for clarity`

---

## üîö Summary

BOS acts as a validation and reasoning layer over the BOS Step Template. It ensures the system of record is:

- Structurally complete
- Internally traceable
- Ontologically aligned
- Ready for signal-driven observability and automation

This document will evolve as BOS functionality expands.
