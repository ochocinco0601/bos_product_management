## Step-by-Step Methodology Guide

### Step 1: WHO depends (Stakeholder Identification)

**Objective**: Identify all stakeholders using BOS stakeholder framework

**Stakeholder Categories**:
- **People**: Internal/external humans (customers, employees, agents)
- **Business Entities**: Organizational entities (processes, requirements, objects)
- **Vendors**: Third-party dependencies (APIs, services, providers)

**Data Collection**:
```json
{
  "stakeholders": {
    "people": [{"name": "", "type": "internal|external", "expectations": "", "criticality": "high|medium|low"}],
    "business_entities": [{"name": "", "type": "process|object|requirement", "dependency": "", "criticality": "high|medium|low"}],
    "vendors": [{"name": "", "service_type": "", "integration_level": "critical|important|optional", "failure_impact": ""}]
  }
}
```

**Validation**: At least one stakeholder in each category with defined expectations and criticality levels

### Step 2: WHAT they expect (Dependency Mapping)

**Objective**: Map specific, measurable expectations for each stakeholder

**Expectation Categories**:
- **Functional**: What they need accomplished
- **Performance**: Speed/reliability requirements
- **Quality**: Accuracy/completeness requirements
- **Availability**: When they need it available

**Data Collection**:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "stakeholder_expectations": [
      {
        "stakeholder_name": "",
        "functional_expectation": "",
        "performance_expectation": "",
        "quality_expectation": "",
        "availability_expectation": "",
        "success_criteria": "",
        "failure_definition": "",
        "measurable_outcome": ""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Validation**: All stakeholders have measurable expectations with clear success criteria

### Step 3: WHAT breaks (Impact Analysis)

**Objective**: Analyze business impacts when expectations aren't met

**Impact Categories**:
- **Financial**: Revenue, cost, transaction impacts
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory violations, compliance failures
- **Operational**: Process disruptions, efficiency losses
- **Customer Experience**: User satisfaction, service quality impacts

**Data Collection**:
```json
{
  "impacts": {
    "failure_scenarios": [{"scenario_name": "", "trigger_conditions": "", "affected_stakeholders": []}],
    "impact_analysis": [
      {
        "scenario_name": "",
        "financial_impact": {"description": "", "measurement": "", "severity": "high|medium|low"},
        "legal_compliance_impact": {"description": "", "measurement": "", "severity": "high|medium|low"},
        "operational_impact": {"description": "", "measurement": "", "severity": "high|medium|low"},
        "customer_experience_impact": {"description": "", "measurement": "", "severity": "high|medium|low"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Validation**: All failure scenarios have measurable impacts in all four categories

### Step 4: WHAT telemetry (Telemetry Mapping)

**Objective**: Map existing and required telemetry sources for impact detection

**Telemetry Types**:
- **Business**: Data reflecting business outcomes and KPIs
- **Process**: Workflow execution and performance data
- **System**: Infrastructure and technical health data
- **User**: User behavior and experience data

**Data Collection**:
```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "existing_sources": [
      {
        "source_name": "",
        "source_type": "logs|metrics|traces|events",
        "coverage_scope": "",
        "quality_level": "high|medium|low",
        "responsible_team": ""
      }
    ],
    "telemetry_gaps": [
      {
        "gap_description": "",
        "required_for_impact": "",
        "implementation_effort": "high|medium|low",
        "responsible_persona": ""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Validation**: All impact scenarios have telemetry coverage with gap analysis

### Step 5: WHAT signals (Signal Definitions)

**Objective**: Define actionable signals from telemetry sources

**Signal Types**:
- **Business Signals**: Business outcomes and KPI indicators
- **Process Signals**: Workflow execution and process performance
- **System Signals**: Infrastructure health and system performance

**Data Collection**:
```json
{
  "signals": {
    "business_signals": [
      {
        "signal_name": "",
        "telemetry_source": "",
        "threshold_values": {"normal": "", "warning": "", "critical": ""},
        "response_action": "",
        "signal_owner": "",
        "related_kpi": ""
      }
    ],
    "process_signals": [
      {
        "signal_name": "",
        "telemetry_source": "",
        "threshold_values": {"success": "", "degraded": "", "failed": ""},
        "response_action": "",
        "signal_owner": "",
        "observable_unit": ""
      }
    ],
    "system_signals": [
      {
        "signal_name": "",
        "telemetry_source": "",
        "threshold_values": {"healthy": "", "degraded": "", "unhealthy": ""},
        "response_action": "",
        "signal_owner": "",
        "platform_context": ""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Validation**: All impact scenarios have corresponding signals with clear thresholds and owners

### Step 6: PLAYBOOK generation (Automated)

**Objective**: Generate Business Impact Playbook from template data

**Generated Sections**:
- Executive Summary (business context)
- Stakeholder Impact Matrix (stakeholders and expectations)
- Impact Scenarios & Response Procedures (failure scenarios and responses)
- Signal Definitions & Thresholds (actionable signals)
- Escalation Matrix (escalation paths and communication)

**Quality Requirements**: >80% template completeness, clear business language, actionable procedures

### Step 7: DASHBOARD requirements (Automated)

**Objective**: Generate Dashboard requirements for Platform SRE

**Generated Sections**:
- Executive Summary (dashboard purpose)
- Layout Design Specification (visual organization)
- Widget Specifications (signal-based widgets)
- Data Source Integration (technical implementation)
- User Experience Requirements (persona-specific views)
- Implementation Guidelines (technical specifications)

**Quality Requirements**: All signals have widgets, technical feasibility validated, UX optimized
