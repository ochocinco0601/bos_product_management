##### zFinalOutput1:Business Observability: Bridging Technical and Business Health
#### Business Observability System (BOS): Bridging Technical and Business Health
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Purpose:** To provide senior business and product leaders with a detailed review of the Business Observability System (BOS), highlighting its core concepts, critical importance, and the profound impact it can have on organizational health and efficiency.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Executive Summary
Our current monitoring approach **"assumes that technical health directly equates to business health,"** leading to **"misleading signals ('green status') during incidents, masking real business risks."** The Business Observability System (BOS) is a **"paradigm shift from system-centric to stakeholder-centric thinking,"** addressing this critical **"blind spot"** by organizing all observability from a business purpose down. By explicitly defining "Business Steps" and their associated business context, stakeholder impacts, and **"true business signals,"** BOS enables **"truthful, immediate visibility into business health."** Implementing BOS requires a commitment to **"problem-focused acceptance criteria"** that measure the actual business problem solved, not just technical correctness, shifting the organization from reactive scrambling to proactive business health, protecting revenue, customer satisfaction, and regulatory compliance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### The Core Problem and Context: A Fundamental Disconnect
The fundamental problem is a **"critical disconnect between our technical systems' reported health and our actual business performance."** This leads to significant operational inefficiencies, unaddressed business risks, and a frustrating lack of clear visibility for leadership during critical moments.
*   **The Immediate Pain Point: Slow and Uninformed Incident Response** During production incidents, business leaders urgently demand to know **"'who and what is the business impact,' and crucially, 'why we didn't know about it.'"** Current systems fail to provide this real-time business context, forcing teams into **"reactive fire drills"** and **"longer time to manually triage issues."** This means we are **"unable to accurately identify business impact during an incident, which has happened multiple times,"** leading to undetected revenue loss, customer pain, and potential regulatory breaches.
*   **The Systemic Flaw: Misleading "Green" Signals and Hidden Business Risk** The current monitoring **"assumes that technical health directly equates to business health."** This flawed assumption repeatedly leads to **"misleading signals ('green status') during incidents,"** effectively **"mask[ing] real business risks."** This is the **"critical 'blind spot'"**: **"Your dashboards? They're glowing green," even when "the business is in pain. Customers are silently struggling, and revenue might be bleeding, undetected by our systems."** Current monitoring is likened to **"'checking for a person's heartbeat, finding it, and declaring they must be healthy and fit for duty,'"** without confirming if the system is truly "fit for duty" or if the underlying business goal was actually achieved. This means our **"software can be technically 'perfect' but silently failing to deliver its intended business value, or even harming the business."** An example cited is credit check services where API calls are successful, but **"for a large percentage of customers, the credit bureau is returning 'no credit score found' – a business failure that our 'green' dashboard completely misses."** This **"false signal" "hides real business risk."**
*   **The Root Cause: Implicit Business Success Measures** The underlying problem is **"not a technical bug, but a 'flawed organizational process.'"** Business success measures, while discussed, are often treated as **"implicit assumptions"** and **"rarely formalized as explicit requirements when we build solutions."** This means software is built to meet functional requirements, but it **"'rarely includes an explicit way to confirm if the underlying business goal was actually achieved.'"** This reliance on technology signals as a poor substitute for business health is the core issue that creates the "blind spots" and the reactive, inefficient incident response.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Introducing the Business Observability System (BOS): The Solution
The Business Observability System (BOS) is designed to resolve these frustrations by enabling **"truthful, immediate visibility into business health."**
*   **Core Definition and Paradigm Shift** BOS is not a replacement for technical monitoring but a **"'paradigm shift from system-centric to stakeholder-centric thinking.'"** It **"organizes** ***all*** **observability – business, process, and system – from a business purpose down."** Its objective is to shift from **"'reacting to problems after they happen' to a 'proactive approach.'"**
*   **How BOS Works: Explicit Definitions and Triangulation** BOS introduces the **"Business Step"** as "the atomic unit of our operations, like 'checking customer credit.'" For each Business Step, BOS requires rigorous definition of:
    *   **Business context**
    *   **Stakeholder impacts** (people, business entities, vendors)
    *   **Business impact categories** (experience, financial, legal risk compliance, operational efficiency) This process enables the identification of **"true business signals"** – "like the 'percentage of customers with actionable credit data' – which reveal problems even when technical systems appear fine."
       BOS enables a powerful **"triangulation"** capability for incident diagnosis:
    *  "If the **business signal is red** but technical signals are green, we know it's a vendor issue, like the 'garbage data' from the credit bureau."
    *  "If a process signal is red, but business and system are green, it's an internal workflow problem."
    *  "If system signals are red but business is still green, we know it's an infrastructure issue that hasn't impacted customers yet." This **"transforms incident triage from 'something's wrong, let's guess where' to 'the signal pattern tells us exactly which domain to investigate.'"**
*   **Strategic Impact and Scope of BOS** BOS is the **"'system that teaches its users how to think about observability types.'"** It is the structured methodology that makes **"'observability-driven development' truly business-aligned."** BOS paves the way for "truthful, immediate visibility into business health," enabling "proactive playbooks" and "eliminating fire drills." BOS is a **"'multi-domain platform capability,' like a wheel or a hammer, with broad impact far beyond just 'better dashboards.'"** It enables "meaningful enterprise health views," integrates with SAFe processes, and provides a foundation for "enterprise-wide observability standardization."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Implementation Strategy: Crawl, Walk, Run
The implementation of BOS is a significant **"paradigm shift"** likened to **"'moving to mars.'"** The plan is a phased **"Crawl, Walk, Run"** approach:
*   **Phase 1: Crawl (Pilot)**Focus on the **loan funding treasury wire process**. The goal is to prove that explicit business validation reduces risks and increases operational clarity. This phase is estimated at **2-4 weeks**.
*   **Phase 2: Walk (Expansion)**Scale the validated approach to 2-3 other critical business processes. Establish standard templates for defining and validating business outcomes. This phase is estimated at **1-2 quarters**.
*   **Phase 3: Run (Institutionalization)**Embed business observability into all product development processes. Create a platform of reusable tools and services, making proactive business observability standard practice enterprise-wide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Common Objections and Responses
Common concerns about implementing Business Observability include:
1.  **"Technical observability is enough."** Technical correctness doesn't guarantee business effectiveness. Features can pass tests but still fail to achieve business outcomes.
2.  **"Business analytics already cover this."** Analytics tools are valuable for historical, strategic insights but do not integrate with real-time operational monitoring or incident management. BOS focuses on operational, real-time visibility.
3.  **"Business outcomes are hard to define."** Leaving outcomes implicit creates unchecked assumptions, significantly increasing operational risk.
4.  **"This slows down delivery."** Short-term speed at the cost of long-term risk and unclear business value is unsustainable and ultimately more costly.
5.  **"The business will escalate if there's an issue."** Reactive escalation is too slow and assumes awareness of all issues, which often isn't the case due to hidden business problems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### The Ask
Our core ask is for you to **support the shift to "problem-focused acceptance criteria."** We need you to **endorse and empower your product teams to consistently use these criteria in their day-to-day work.** This means that acceptance criteria will measure if a solution **"'actually solves the business problem, not just if it is technically correct.'"** This critical process change will enable the creation of new tools and dashboards that provide a truthful signal of business health, which in turn will allow for proactive playbooks and the elimination of reactive fire drills. This is how the organization can **"move from reactive scrambling to proactive business health, ensuring our technology truly reflects business reality and protects us from hidden risks."**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Scoping Outline for Discussion
To facilitate the discussion on implementing Business Observability, we should clarify the following aspects:
**Roles & Responsibilities:**
*   **Product Owner:** Define business success criteria, KPIs.
*   **Development Team:** Implement business validation in code.
*   **Platform/SRE:** Build monitoring infrastructure for business metrics.
*   **Central SRE (You):** Template design, governance, enablement.
*   **Business Stakeholders:** Validate relevance of success measures.

**How We Did It (LOS Example - Loan Origination System):**
*  Partnered directly with an application development team.
*  Used their business knowledge to define success metrics.
*  Built dashboards showing business health, not just technical health.
*  It worked because we explicitly defined what business success looked like.
**What We Need:**
*  Business success criteria as explicit requirements (not assumptions).
*  Templates for capturing business validation logic.
*  Integration with existing development processes.
*  Dashboard capability for business metrics.

**Effort Estimation (Per Business Process -** ***Rough Estimates for Discussion*** **):**
*  BOS Templates: **1-2 working sessions** per process.
*  Business metric definition: Product Owner + **4-6 hours**.
*  Implementation: Development team + **8-12 hours**.
*  Dashboard creation: Platform team + **6-8 hours**.
*  Validation workshops: Cross-team + **2-4 hours**.
**Implementation Approach:** (Already covered in "Implementation Strategy" above, but listed for discussion)
*  Crawl: Pilot with funding service (**2-4 weeks**).
*  Walk: Scale to 2-3 critical processes (**1-2 quarters**).
*  Run: Embed in all development processes (enterprise-wide).

**Dependencies:**
*  Product teams must participate in defining success criteria.
*  Development teams need capacity for business validation work.
*  Platform teams need tooling for business metric collection.
