### **Business Observability Solution (BOS) Strategic Charter**

**1. Executive Summary**

BOS will establish a repeatable framework to transform technical data into business-contextualized alerts and dashboards. This ensures clear business service level objectives and immediate clarity on business impact. BOS empowers all stakeholders—from development and platform teams to product owners and executive leadership—to make informed decisions during incidents. This drives measurable business value through faster response times. A pilot effort will provide early proof of concept for BOS.

**2. Problem Statement: Current Challenges**

Our current observability presents key challenges impacting business understanding and reaction:

* **Disconnected Business Context:** Technical observability lacks business context, slowing business impact assessment during incidents and creating delays in stakeholder communication.  
* **Unclear Ownership & Accountability Gaps:** Widespread lack of clear business service level objectives leads to missed signals and business impact blind spots.  
* **Outdated & Static Observability:** Dashboards fail to keep pace with changing business priorities, creating a "False Confidence Problem" where technical "green" status hides real business issues while relying on individual expertise rather than structured processes.

This creates an "Organizational Accountability Challenge": technical teams are responsible for business impact they cannot define.

**3. Vision & Objectives: Bridging the Gap**

The BOS vision is to create a system that makes business impact observable by design. This initiative shifts observability from an infrastructure concern to a tool for managing business impact, supporting prioritization and risk decisions.

**3.1. Overarching Goals for BOS:**

* Connect technical telemetry to business outcomes.  
* Establish clear ownership for every signal.  
* Reduce time to identify business impact during incidents.  
* Create a repeatable, scalable approach for business observability.  
* Produce actionable artifacts (e.g., business-aligned dashboards, alerts, playbooks).  
* Integrate with Agile delivery processes (SAFe).

**3.2. Specific Measurable Objectives (Success Metrics):**

Upon successful implementation of BOS, we aim to achieve:

* **Faster Business Impact Identification:** Significantly decrease the time to identify the business impact of incidents.  
* **Clear Signal Ownership Framework:** Establish ownership for all business-critical signals with complete accountability.  
* **Measurable MTTR Reduction:** Contribute to reduced Mean Time to Resolution for business-impacting incidents and increased dashboard utilization during incident response.

**4. Core Capabilities of BOS:**

BOS will deliver core capabilities enabling business-first observability:

* **Business Observability Requirements Authoring System (BOS RAS):** A system to centralize and manage observability requirements, replacing tribal knowledge with documented requirements.  
* **Service Registry Platform:** Standardizes and registers all services, enabling service relationship mapping and data enrichment.
* **Semantic Model:** Enables multiple stakeholder views by providing consistent data structure across technical and business contexts.

**5. Non-Goals for BOS:**

To manage expectations and focus, BOS explicitly defines the following:

* **Not a New Monitoring Tool:** BOS complements, not replaces, existing technical monitoring tools by adding business context.  
* **Not a One-Time Project:** BOS is a continuous capability, not a single implementation.  
* **No Replacement for Existing Processes:** BOS integrates with and enhances current SAFe planning and operational processes.  
* **Not a Purely Technical Solution:** BOS addresses a systemic organizational challenge of fragmented observability and unclear ownership, beyond just technical deficiencies.

**6. Key Stakeholders & High-Level Roles:**

* **Executive Sponsors:** Provide strategic prioritization, remove organizational blockers, and champion the BOS vision.  
* **Central SRE Team:** Strategic direction, toolkit design, template governance, observability-as-code architecture.  
* **Product Owners & Business Owners:** Define business outcomes, KPIs, business signals, and validate signal relevance.  
* **Development Teams:** Define process signals, validate alert logic, maintain observability configurations.  
* **Platform SRE Teams:** Define system signals, validate dashboards, ensure observability infrastructure reliability.  
* **Enterprise Observability Platform Teams:** Provide access and support for core monitoring platforms.

**7. Strategic Alignment: Elevating Observability to a Strategic Asset**

BOS integrates with SAFe processes as Enabler Features, ensuring observability becomes standard development practice. This should reduce MTTR for business-impacting incidents by providing immediate business context during response.
