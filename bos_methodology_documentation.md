# Business Observability System (BOS) - Stakeholder-First Discovery Methodology

## Overview

This documentation defines the systematic business observability design methodology using stakeholder-first discovery. It transforms abstract business impact requirements into concrete, measurable technical implementation.

---

## Core Problem

### Problem Statement
**Current approach of discovering business impact during incidents creates communication delays and response prioritization failures.**

### Enterprise Context

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Scale** | Large financial enterprise with 1000+ business applications across multiple lines of business (home lending, automotive loans, credit cards) |
| **Users** | Hundreds of product owners with varying expertise levels (75% business-focused, 25% technical) |
| **Current State** | No existing systematic process for documenting business impact - teams scramble during incidents to identify stakeholders, research dependencies, and find domain experts |
| **Objective** | Pre-design business observability into software development lifecycle to enable immediate incident impact communication |

---

## Stakeholder-First Methodology

### Core Principle
**Product owners must identify WHO depends before determining WHAT impacts occur to ensure meaningful business observability.**

### Rationale
Without knowing stakeholder dependencies, teams cannot systematically design measurable business impact indicators. You cannot instrument what you haven't identified as needing measurement.

### Discovery Sequence
1. **WHO depends on this step**
2. **WHAT they need/expect/require**
3. **WHAT breaks when step fails**
4. **WHAT telemetry must exist to detect impact**
5. **WHAT signals to instrument in Observable Units**

---

## The Observability Design Chain

### Description
Reusable mental framework for any business observability challenge.

### The Chain
```
WHO depends on this step
    ↓
WHAT they need/expect/require
    ↓
WHAT breaks when step fails
    ↓
WHAT telemetry must exist to detect impact
    ↓
WHAT signals to instrument in Observable Units
```

### Application
This systematic methodology transforms abstract observability requirements into concrete technical implementation by making stakeholder identification discoverable and connecting business value to technical function.

## Stakeholder Categories

### People
**Description:** Internal or external, human customers, users, employees, agents

**Examples:**
- Loan applicants
- Customer service agents
- Loan officers
- Compliance staff

### Business Entities
**Description:** Organizational or transactional entities including business objects and regulatory requirements

**Examples:**
- Mortgage applications
- Customer accounts
- Compliance requirements
- Loan portfolios

### Vendors
**Description:** Third-party dependencies and integrations

**Examples:**
- Credit bureaus
- Document delivery services
- Fraud detection providers
- Payment processors

---

## Impact Categories

### Overview
Four measurable impact categories that can be instrumented via system telemetry.

### Financial
**Description:** Money movement, transactions, revenue impact that systems can track

**Examples:**
- Transaction failures
- Revenue loss
- Processing cost increases
- Application abandonment

### Legal/Compliance
**Description:** Regulatory violations, compliance check failures, risk thresholds that systems can detect

**Examples:**
- Disclosure deadline violations
- Regulatory reporting gaps
- Compliance check failures

### Operational
**Description:** Process performance, throughput, efficiency metrics that systems can measure

**Examples:**
- Processing delays
- Manual intervention increases
- SLA violations
- Productivity loss

### Customer Experience
**Description:** User interaction quality, satisfaction metrics that systems can observe

**Examples:**
- Response time degradation
- Error rates
- Session abandonment
- Support call increases

## Validation Framework

### Description
Traceability test methodology to validate template completeness.

### Trace Test
For any business step example, stakeholders should be able to start at any point in the model and follow visual connections to see the complete chain, identifying missing elements if the trace breaks or dead-ends.

### Validation Paths

#### Forward Validation
```
Stakeholders → Impact Categories → Signal Types → Signals → Measurable Impact → Business Consequences
```

#### Backward Validation
```
Business Consequences → Identifies which specific stakeholder groups are affected
```

#### Incident Readiness
```
Technical Failure → Step Impact → Stakeholder Effects → Measurable Impact Categories → Executive-ready Business Consequences
```

### Completeness Criteria
- Every stakeholder type has identified dependencies
- Every impact category has measurement signals
- Every signal connects to observable units
- Incident narrative can be generated from template data

## Persona Responsibilities

### Product Owner
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Scope** | Business flow, stakeholder identification, impact analysis, business value definition |
| **Key Responsibility** | Populate stakeholder-first discovery fields using systematic methodology |
| **Expertise Requirement** | Business domain knowledge (technical expertise not required) |

### Development
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Scope** | Technical implementation, observable unit definition, process signal design |
| **Key Responsibility** | Map business steps to technical components and workflow signals |
| **Expertise Requirement** | System architecture and implementation knowledge |

### Platform SRE
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Scope** | System health, infrastructure context, system signal design |
| **Key Responsibility** | Ensure foundational systems are observable and platform context is captured |
| **Expertise Requirement** | Infrastructure and platform operations knowledge |

### BOS System
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Scope** | Validation, pattern enforcement, KPI generation |
| **Key Responsibility** | Systematic validation and structural completeness checking |
| **Automation** | Validates traceability, generates KPIs from signals, enforces ontology relationships |

---

## Implementation Guidance

### Form Generation

#### Product Owner Fields
Generate guided discovery forms with examples and prompts for each stakeholder category and impact type.

#### Development Fields
Create structured forms for observable unit tagging and process signal definition.

#### Platform SRE Fields
Provide system signal and infrastructure context forms.

#### Validation Integration
Include real-time validation feedback using BOS system fields.

### Validation Implementation

#### Trace Checking
Implement validation that can trace from stakeholders through impact categories to measurable signals.

#### Completeness Scoring
Calculate percentage completion across required fields and relationships.

#### Pattern Validation
Check observable unit signals against expected patterns based on type tags.

### Incident Narrative Generation

#### Template
```
When {observable_unit} fails, {affected_stakeholders} cannot {expected_dependencies}, 
resulting in {measurable_impacts} across {impact_categories}
```

#### Data Sources
Combine real-time signal data with pre-defined stakeholder and impact information.

#### Executive Communication
Generate business consequences that connect technical failure to stakeholder effects to measurable business impacts.

## Example Methodology Application

### Scenario
**Customer logs in to view the status of their online mortgage application**

### Stakeholder Identification

#### People
- Mortgage applicant (customer)
- Customer service agents

#### Business Entities
- Mortgage application (status accuracy)
- Customer account

#### Vendors
- Authentication service provider
- Third-party credit monitoring

### Dependency Mapping

#### People Expect
- Current, accurate application status and next steps
- Ability to provide customer support

#### Entities Require
- Status updates reflected accurately in system
- Secure access maintained

#### Vendors Require
- Authentication responses within SLA
- Status data for credit monitoring

### Impact Analysis

#### Financial
Application abandonment if status unavailable

#### Legal/Compliance
Customer transparency requirements

#### Operational
Customer service call volume increase

#### Customer Experience
Portal usability degradation, status accessibility issues

### Measurement Signals
- Login success rate
- Portal response time
- Status retrieval latency
- Customer service call volume

### Incident Narrative
**"Customer portal login failures preventing 847 applicants from checking status, customer service calls up 156%, portal response time degraded to 8 seconds"**
